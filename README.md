# Typitaca

## Motivation

We propose a distribution format as the next generation Common Lisp ecosystem. 
In the traditional ecosystem, conflicting dependencies between libraries and lack of documentation have been problems.
Therefore, we aim to provide users with a well-tested, well-documented and consistent Common Lisp environment
through regular distribution formats such as Haskell, Racket, and TeX.

## Policy

- We test all libraries.
- We provide source code.
- We provide documents for all libraries.
- We updates libraries every 6 months.
- We support no libraries out of the distribution.

## Packages

- SBCL

## Notice

Thank you for all the interest in this project. However, do understand that this is very much a non-functional prototype. There's a huge amount of heavy lifting to do. Unless you are participating in that, please maintain radio silence on github. This includes submitting trivial PRs (like improving README build instructions).
